## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpaceShooterSFML.git
   cd SpaceShooterSFML
   ```

2. **Install SFML**:
   - **Windows**: Download SFML from [sfml-dev.org](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and follow the setup guide.
   - **Linux**:
     ```bash
